### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Batali89/Batali89** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m now a SE ALX Student.
- ğŸŒ± This is my first respository as a SE Engineer.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on soccer coaching projects, research, kids projects and NGO development.
- ğŸ¤” I'm looking for volunteers, partners, donors, online internship to fully establish our children's organization.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Grassroot sports, hardship experience, starting from nothing.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me:

     Email: batalherobatals@gmail.com
     Tell: +256777279718

- âš¡ Fun fact: Children are fun, Let's put more smile on their faces.
               I think, " We can't change the world unless we transform the Children."
